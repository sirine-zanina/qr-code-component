## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to properly use `flexbox` for centering elements both vertically and horizontally.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued Development

Mention any areas where you'd like to improve or concepts you'd like to explore further. Example:

```markdown
I want to focus on:
- Using media queries to make designs even more responsive.
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for layout designs.
- Improving my CSS naming conventions (e.g., using BEM).
